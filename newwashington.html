					<img src="images/pac2.jpg"/>
					<p>More locally known in its Spanish term, Pacto de Sangre and by the official term by the National Historical Commission as Sanduguan. 
					This historical marker located in Sitio Kuntang, Barangay Ochando commemorates the historic event that happened on March 3, 1887, 
					which fueled the patriotic spirit of the local revolutionaries to defy Aklanon Katipuneros expressed their strong defiance against 
					Spain by way of tearing the cedula personal and signing a document in their cause. The document was a manuscript of revolutionary 
					declaration of the Philippine Independence. The Katipuneros were Romualdo Dalida, Isidro Jimenez, Cornelio Delfin, Valeriano Dalida, 
					Benito Motus and Juan Dalida, all natives of Fonda Lagatik (now New Washington), Capiz, now known as Aklan.
					<br/>
