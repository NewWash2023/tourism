                    <h1 class="mb-5">Brief History of New Washington</h1>
				<p style="font-family: arial;"> A long narrow strip coastal town in the Eastern District of Aklan - it stretches down the south-eastern most part of the province whose shorelines
				on the east faces the vast Sibuyan Sea, on the west it laps the smooth brackish waters of Lagatik River looking over the majestic peak of Madya-as mountain,
				 and its tip ends at the mouth of Batan Bay. Famed once as the provincial shipping Harbor of Aklan, it boast twoo safest ports in the entire province that could accomodate modern
				 containerized-cargo and luxury passenger vessels bound for Manila-Ceb and other shipping routes. That is New Washington - home of prominent figures in the churches, in business and in government.
				 <br/>
				 <br/>
				 Several hundred years ago before New Washington officialy got its American namesake in 1903, it was known to be a prosperous riverbank settlement of native inhabitants. It was
				 called Fonda Lagatik, named after the Lagatik River where the settlement was geographically situated. As an important settlement in Batang territory - just across its bay on the northwestern side- Lagatik offered a safe natural harbor for praws and balandras (small and big sailboats).
				 This strategic location of Fonda Lagatik had given prominence to Batang (now Batan), once the seat of power of the third Cheiftain of Akean, Datu Bedahara Kalantiw, who decreed the famous
				 "Code of Kalantiaw".
				 <br/>
				 <br/>
				 Thus Lagatik has a history that dates back to the eventful "Purchase of Madya-as" by ten Bornean Datus who established the three major "settlements" in Madya-as (Panay Island) namely: Hamtik
				 (Antique), Irong-irong (Iloilo), and Akean (Capiz and Aklan) at about the middle of the 13th century, an event recorded in old Visayan Chronicle, called the "Maragtas"
				 <br/>
				 <br/>
				 With the arrival of Spaniards some centuries later, Lagatik was already trading community and a haven for seafaring vessels. Trade was lucarative, particularly copra, hemp, firewood
				 , bark and dried fish. People from other places migrated for economic opportunities which later on prompted the native inhabitants to call the pace "Fonda Lagatik".
				 <br/>
				 <br/>
				 At the onset of the Philippine Revolution against Spain, Fonda Lagatik had been known as a progressive trading barangay of Pueblo del Batan. When the Katipunan Supremo Andres
				 Bonifacio heard this place, he sent one of his trusted aide to organize the Katipunan in the Visayan region, making Lagatik the jump-off of all revolutionary activities in Panay,
				 considering its strategic position as a natural harbor. After several secret meetings of the Local Katipuneros, the historic "Pacto de Sangre" was carried out in Sitio Kuntang
				 on March 3,1897, an event that fueled the patriotic spiirit of the local revolutionaries to defy and resist the Spanish oppresive rule.
				 <br/>
				 <br/>
				 In Nineteen Hundred Three(1903), when the Philippine Islands weas taken by the Americans from the Spaniards, thje residents of Fonda Lagatik petitioned the Philippine Civil Commission
				 (which commissioned to organized all local governments in the islands) to create the coalition of settlements of Batan, Jimeno (Altacvas), Balete, and Lagatik (New Washington)
				 into a new municipality to named New Washington in honor to George Washington, the first President of the United Staes of America. In April 4,1903, the petition was approved
				 creating the Municipality of New Washington, with Lagatik as the seat of government, hen under the political and territoral jurisdiction of the province of Capiz. The following
				 year, in 1904, the first local election was held, with Mr. Juan Oquendo of Balete elected as the first Municipal President. On January 15 of that the same year, the newly formed municipality was
				 officially inaugurated and the first set of municipal officials were sworn into office.
				 <br/>
				 <br/>
				 Later on, when the three settlements of Batan, Jimeno (Altavas), and Balete asked for separation to become new independent municipalities, New Washington was left with the main coastal
				 land of Lagatik, its elongated islet just across the Lagatik River, its river tributaries and marshlands, and some few sparse of plains and rice fields in its interior frontiers.
				 <br/>
				 <br/>
				 When Aklan separated from Capiz on April 25, 1956, New Washington become one of the seventeen municipalities of the newly created province. Presently, New Washington is comprised of the
				 sixteen barangays, including the Poblacion. It ranks third among the top-four municipalities (namely: Kalibo, Malay, New Washington and Ibajay) in the province in terms of population,
				 trade and commerce, eco-tourist, coastal resource management program, infrastracture projects, and other major investments programs. Since 1904 to the present, 18 Chief Executives
				 had been elected to the town's top post from Municipality President Juan Oquendo- to Atty. Edgar R. Peralta- the Municipal Mayor for the term CY 2007-2010.</p>
